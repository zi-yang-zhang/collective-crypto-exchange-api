Ultra performant API Gateway with middlewares

## Motivation

Consumers of REST API content (specially in microservices) often query backend services that weren't coded for the UI implementation. This is of course a good practice, but the UI consumers need to do implementations that suffer a lot of complexity and burden with the sizes of their microservices responses.

KrakenD is an **API Gateway** builder and proxy generator that sits between the client and all the source servers, adding a new layer that removes all the complexity to the clients, providing them only the information that the UI needs. KrakenD acts as an **aggregator** of many sources into single endpoints and allows you to group, wrap, transform and shrink responses. Additionally it supports a myriad of middelwares and plugins that allow you to extend the functionality, such as adding Oauth authorization or security layers.

KrakenD not only supports HTTP(S), but because it is a set of generic libraries you can build all type of API Gateways and proxies, including for instance, a RPC gateway.

### Practical Example

Fred Calamari is a mobile developer that needs to construct a single front page that requires data from several calls to their backend services, e.g:

    1) api.store.server/products
    2) api.store.server/marketing-promos
    3) api.users.server/users/{id_user}
    4) api.users.server/shopping-cart/{id_user}

The screen is very simple and _only_ needs to retrieve data from 4 different sources, wait for the round trip and then pick only a few fields of the response. Instead of thing these calls, the mobile could call a single endpoint to KrakenD:

    1) krakend.server/frontpage/{id_user}

And this is how it would look like:

The difference in size in this example would be because KrakenD server would have removed unneeded attributes from the responses.

## What's in this repository?
The source code on which the [KrakenD](http://www.krakend.io) service core is built on. It is designed to work with your own middleware and extend the functionality by using small, independent, reusable components following the Unix philosophy.

**This repository is only for those who want to build from source a Krakend service** or for those who will reuse any of the components in another application.

If you just want to use the server, please [download the binary for your architecture](http://www.krakend.io/download).


## Library Usage
Krakend is presented as a **go library** that you can include in your own go application to build a powerful proxy or API gateway. In order to get you started several examples of implementations are included in the `examples` folder.

Of course you will need [go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system to compile the code.
There is a `Makefile` in every example that will download library dependencies and compile a binary for you to test. Just run:

    $ cd examples/gin
    $ make

Or, if you want to build all the examples, from the root of the project

    $ make

For the lazy, a ready to use example:

```go
    package main

    import (
        "flag"
        "log"
        "os"

        "github.com/devopsfaith/krakend/config/viper"
        "github.com/devopsfaith/krakend/logging"
        "github.com/devopsfaith/krakend/proxy"
        "github.com/devopsfaith/krakend/router/gin"
    )

    func main() {
        port := flag.Int("p", 0, "Port of the service")
        logLevel := flag.String("l", "ERROR", "Logging level")
        debug := flag.Bool("d", false, "Enable the debug")
        configFile := flag.String("c", "/etc/krakend/configuration.json", "Path to the configuration filename")
        flag.Parse()

        parser := viper.New()
        serviceConfig, err := parser.Parse(*configFile)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal("ERROR:", err.Error())
        }
        serviceConfig.Debug = serviceConfig.Debug || *debug
        if *port != 0 {
            serviceConfig.Port = *port
        }

        logger := logging.NewLogger(*logLevel, os.Stdout, "[KRAKEND]")

        routerFactory := gin.DefaultFactory(proxy.DefaultFactory(logger), logger)

        routerFactory.New().Run(serviceConfig)
    }
```
